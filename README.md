# Memry
Memry is a web-based learning tool designed to help users retain concepts and ideas using a spaced repetition–inspired flashcard system.

The project was built as a practical implementation of a flashcard system, inspired by a project idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). It focuses on reinforcing learning through active recall while serving as a hands-on frontend engineering exercise.

## Features
* Create, view, and manage flashcards
* Pre-defined flashcards for imediate use
* Local storage persistence (no backend required)
* Respnsive and accessible UI
* Minimal, distraction-free designed optimized for study

## Tech Stack
* HTML5 - semantic structure
* CSS3 - layout, styling, and responsiveness
* JavaScript (ES6+) - state management, DOM manipulation, and persistence
* LocalStorage API - client-side data storage.

## Learning Objectives
This project was built to: 
* Strengthen understanding of JavaScriptt fundamentals
* Practice state management without frameworks
* Work with browser APIs (LocalStorage)
* Improve UI/UX decisions for learning focused tools
* Reinforce clean, modular frontend code structure
* Strengthen my understanding of git and GitHub
